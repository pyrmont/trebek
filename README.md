Trebek
======

Trebek is an elegant way to run surveys and questionnaires.

Do you want to write a survey in a simple plain text file and have an HTML form come out the other end? Trebek does that.

Do you want to be able to take the content of an HTML form and process that? Trebek does that, too.

Do you want to be able to see the results of your surveys? Trebek to the rescue again.
