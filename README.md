Trebek
======

Trebek is an elegant way to run surveys and questionnaires.

As a convention that frequently interacts with its attendees we're forever running into situations where we just want a simple way to run a survey. Unfortunately, most of the free solutions out there look awful. We wanted something that maintained the visual standards of SMASH! while at the same time not costing us an arm and a leg. Using the excellent  [Surveyor](https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor) gem, Trebek is a Rails application that makes it easy to create questionnaires that look good and work great.


Caveats
-------

Trebek is being developed for internal use. We wanted to develop it in the open and hope to produce something that is a little more general-purpose in time. For the moment, please mind the mess.
